# Golang-Based-Web-Project

I am starting my golang learning journey for my professional programming career.

The main goal of this repository is to become a master at these specific topics in golang:

- channels
- template caching
- goroutines
- middleware
- unit testing
- state management with sessions
- authentication
- deployment the golang project
